# Constructive Geometries #

This repository contains the scripts and data needed to build a consistent topology of the world (provinces, countries, and states), needed for the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database. It also includes the ability to define recipes to generate custom locations.

The repository is a mix of SQL, bash scripts, and Python. See the file "topology-journal.rst" for instructions and journal of what was done and why.
